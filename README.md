# CS4320FinalProject
Our project is a bot that will assist in organizing Scrum using [GroupMe](https://groupme.com) (for communication), [Waffle](https://waffle.io) (for project management), and [GitHub](https://GitHub.com) (for version control).  The bot will help coordinate and organize actions from all three services.

A guide to using the bot can be found [here](Guide.md).
